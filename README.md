# DDAREUNGI_Prject
As a part of Data Science Project, our team created an AI model that can predict the rental rate of DDAREUNGI, which is a public bike in Seoul, in each stations. 
In this project, I contributed in constructing an XGBoost ensemble model and creating a web demo using Streamlit. 
This repository comprised of app.py for a web demo and data folder for visual aid of model design and data processing.
